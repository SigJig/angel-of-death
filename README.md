## GEDCOM Parser

This project is a project I did to learn C. It is based on the assignment described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S20NcDLF_t4).
In this project however, I have only implemented the parser as the rest is lame and boring and I do not want to do it.

I haven't finished it yet, really the only thing that is missing is to enter the data for each structure
